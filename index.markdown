<!-- Github calls these pages static, 
     but you can use javascript and XHR to have a dynamic feel 
     and allows to explore (meta) data using API's -->
<!-- Using jekyll and markdown 
     because that is the default with those pages 
     and it allows me to get a fast 'preview when developing -->

<!-- Instead of using the 'blog' capabilities with posts I just put the content here -->
